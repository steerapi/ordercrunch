By default, alternates vowels and\nconsonants, for maximum pronounceability.  Uses its own\nlist of consonants, which excludes f and c and k to prevent\ngenerating obscene-sounding passwords. Number 1 and\nlowercase l are excluded on the basis of looking like\neach other. Number 0 is also excluded so as not to be mistaken for\nuppercase O. An uppercase letter and symbol are used by default.\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install randpass\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\nvar randpass = require('randpass');\nrandpass(); // Generates an 8 character password with alternating vowels and consonants, using\n            // the default 1 uppercase letter, 1 number, and 1 symbol\nrandpass(10); // Generates a 10 character password with alternating vowels and consonants, using\n              // the default 1 uppercase letter, 1 number, and 1 symbol\nrandpass({length: 12, symbols: false, capitals: false, alternate: false}); // Generates a 12 character\n                                                                           // password without alternating\n                                                                           // vowels and consonants and no\n                                                                           // symbols or uppercase letters\n```\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Dan MacTough &lt;danmactough@gmail.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n",
